<p>Since I’ve read “The Call of The Wild” by Jack London, I was totally caught by a poem in the epigraph of the book, which is named “Atavism” and authored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Myers_O%27Hara">John Myers O Hara</a></p>
<p>So, here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old longings nomadic leap
Chafing at custom’s chain
Again from its brumal sleep
Wakens the ferine strain.</p>
<p>Helots of houses no more
Let us be out, be free!
Fragrance through the window and door
Wafts from the woods, the sea!</p>
<p>After the torpor of will
Morbid the inner strife
Welcome the animal thrill
Lending a zest to life.</p>
<p>Banish the volumes revered
Sever from centuries dead
Ceilings the lamp flicker cheered
Barter for stars instead.</p>
<p>Temple, thy dreams with the trees
Nature thy god alone
Worship the sun and the breeze
Altars where non atone.</p>
<p>Voices of Solitude call,
Whisper of sedge and stream
Loosen the fetters that gall
Back to the primal scheme.</p>
<p>Feel the great throbbing terrene
Pulse in thy body beat!
Conscious again of the green
Verdure beneath the feet.</p>
<p>Callous to pain as the rose,
Breathe with instinct’s delight
Live the existence that goes
Soulless into the night.</p>
<p>John Myers O Hara</p>
